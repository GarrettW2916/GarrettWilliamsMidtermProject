                        <p>Frank McGuire led the team to its first NCAA championship in 1957. Then coach Dean Smith eventually took over and established the program as a powerhouse in college basketball. The Tar Heels secured two national championships under Smith and have won the national championships three times under current coach Roy Williams.</p>
