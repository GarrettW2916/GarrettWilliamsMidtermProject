                    <h2 class= "shadow">Duke - North Carolina</h2>
                        <p>The Duke–North Carolina rivalry refers to the rivalry between the Duke University Blue Devils (Duke) and University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill Tar Heels (North Carolina). It most often refers to the athletic rivalries between the Duke Blue Devils and North Carolina Tar Heels athletic teams. The North Carolina–Duke rivalry is fierce, particularly in men's college basketball. It is considered one of the most intense rivalries in all of US-sports.</p>
                    <h2 class="shadow">NC State - North Carolina</h2>   
                        <p>While nobody would argue that this is a balanced rivalry, that doesn’t change the fact of its existence. It is really, really unbalanced—the best two coaches in N.C. State’s history, Norm Sloan and Jim Valvano, went a combined 20-44 against Dean Smith’s program. The only two decades from which the Wolfpack emerged with the upper-hand were the 1910s and the 1950s. As of today, there are only two Wolfpack coaches with a winning record against their Chapel Hill counterparts: Everett Case (who led the program from 1946-1964) and Kevin Keatts, N.C. State’s current head coach. He was hired prior to this season and his record currently sits at 1-0.</p>
