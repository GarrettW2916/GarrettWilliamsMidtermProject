                        <p>I have been a huge North Carolina fan my entire life. I enjoy watching them play football and basketball, but basketball is by far my favorite of the two. I have never been entirely sure why I have always loved UNC it may have been, becuase that is where MJ played. MJ is my favorite player of all time, I have watched all his highlights and love watching any of his games.</p>   
                        <p>I was raised in Holcomb, Kansas. Watching UNC play basketball really shaped me when I was younger. All my time was spent playing basketball, from playing travelling tournaments in Chicago to playing at the park with my friends. I was even blessed enough to win multiple state championships in basketball in highschool. I got offered to play basketball at Garden City Community College, but I chose to run track instead since I was better at that.  </p>
